This is an attempt to implement Ext.Direct (see http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect for more info)

I wanted to have a library that did not explicitly bind to any ORM(like ActiveRecord, Datamapper, ...).
The idea is very simple just add an 'api' and 'router' path to your backend point to your exposed classes and you are set.

Example: (See examples directory for more)
Add this to your Gemfile
  gem 'ruby_ext_direct', :require => 'ext_direct'
